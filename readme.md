# ~~ DEPRECATION NOTICE ~~

**This package is no longer maintained and is being deprecated**

Please try using something like picqer's [php barcode generator](https://github.com/picqer/php-barcode-generator) written in modern PHP and has been actively developed and maintained. It supports a lot more than this and can be installed with composer.

Barcode Generator for PHP
=========================

Perhaps the biggest issue I encountered when creating an inventory management
system for a client was the fact that there was no unified framework for 
barcode generation in PHP that was reasonable in price, much less Open Source.
I hope to fill this gaping hole in the market today with Barcode Generator for
PHP.

I forked this project because we needed code128 barcodes. I added text to the bottom of the barcodes (Human readable text)
